The Iron Yard Daily Project: Return to Robots

Using the MongoDB Node library, create the LinkedIn for Robots project.

In week 1 of Back-End Fundamentals, you built [a directory site with job and skill information for robots](https://github.com/carlotapearl/Express-Mustache-User-Directory).

Today, you should download the same data you used in that project. The download link is included here.

> [data.js](https://tiy-learn-content.s3.amazonaws.com/36d3402e-data.js) (23 KB)

Load this data into MongoDB and rebuild the directory site. You will have to query the database via the `MongoDB library` (mongodb) to get this data.

This time, add links at the top of the page to go to a page of robots that are currently looking for work and a page of robots that are currently employed.
